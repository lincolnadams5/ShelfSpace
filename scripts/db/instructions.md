# Creating the Database Locally
1. Open pgAdmin
2. Navigate to your Servers (put in your password)
3. Create a new server and call it whatever you'd like
4. Right click the server and select the Query Tool (second from the bottom)
5. Paste the SQL Script and run it
6. Within the server navigate to Schemas -> Public -> Tables
7. Verify this worked by checking the table information


Note: If you need to update values in the database, make sure those changes are reflected in the sql script as well to ensure future creations of the database are correct.
